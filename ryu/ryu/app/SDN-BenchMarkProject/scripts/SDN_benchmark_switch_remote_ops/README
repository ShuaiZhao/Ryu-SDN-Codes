before you can use any scripts here, you need to make sure your control as ssh into any of your OVS switches

to make things easier, make ssh keyless

1. create a ssh key on controller: 
	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
2. Then log in to your OVS. add just created public key from controller to each of your OVS
	#!/bin/bash
	# add_controller_public_key_to_auth.sh
	public_key=''

	cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys << EOF
	$public_key
	EOF

3. Try to ssh into each of your OVS now
	ssh OVS-IP-Addresss
